# Live-Admin

Live-Admin is an admin template created by integrating Laravel, Vue3 and Inertia.js with the UI Toolkit Element Plus and css utility Tailwind. The work is inspired by vue-element-admin with the latest versions of the stack integrated with vite bundler for a rapid development experience. With the powerful Laravel framework as the backend, Vue3 as the high performance on the front end integrated with Inertia js, vite as a bundler, Live-admin appears to be a full-stack solution for an enterprise application level.
