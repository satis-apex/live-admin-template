# Live-Admin

![LIVE Admin Template](https://iili.io/HqHBmej.jpg)

Live-Admin is an admin template created by integrating Laravel, Vue3 and Inertia.js with the UI Toolkit Element Plus and css utility Tailwind. The work is inspired by vue-element-admin with the latest versions of the stack integrated with vite bundler for a rapid development experience. With the powerful Laravel framework as the backend, Vue3 as the high performance on the front end integrated with Inertia js, vite as a bundler, Live-admin appears to be a full-stack solution for an enterprise application level.

## Features:

-   Dynamic menu management with the recorder.
-   Role Permission integrated with the menu
-   User Impersonate option for admin only.
-   Option to generate Controller, Model and Service class (all about personal preferences and coding standard)
-   Laravel Module Implemented with database activator
-   Ability to create fully functional Demo Crud file from add Manage Menu UI dynamically
-   Dark mode Compatible
-   Notification bell integrated with laravel notification (database,broadcast)
-   Event Announcement integrated with Full calender library
-   Broadcast Event Announcement using Laravel-websockets

## Requirement

Prior running application make sure your machine meets all the defaults requirements from [laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/deployment#server-requirements) and also include the following

-   [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version: [16.13.1](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
-   [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
-   php-gd2 library extension
-   php-exif extension

## Installation

Use the [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) to install php dependencies.

```bash
composer install
```

Use the [npm](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_npm.asp) to install js dependencies.

```bash
npm install

#development server
npm run dev

#production server
npm run build
```

### Donâ€™t forget .env.example

form your root application folder rename [.env.example](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/9.x/.env.example)
to .env and update the corrersponding value to your need.

Inside .env MODULE_ACTIVATOR must be set to "file" initially before table migration else an error occurs. (library-specific issue). After successful migration you can change it manually, or "php artisan live:migrate" will do this automatically for you )

    MODULE_ACTIVATOR=file

```bash
#generates key for session encryption
php artisan key:generate

#create symlink in public folder
php artisan storage:link

#configure env file for laravel-websocket and migrate database and seed data
php artisan live:initialize
```

### Enabling laravel Schelule

laravel websocket package provides the artisan command "websockets:clean" to clean up old statistics from the websocket log in the database table, but needs to run the command manually. I have created a laravel schedule to run this command daily.You also need to add a cron entry to your server's crontab file to run the Laravel schedule every minute:

```bash
#linux/mac users only
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1

#window/linux/mac user -manually runs untile server shutdowns
php artisan schedule:work
```

## Usage

```bash
#start local php server
php artisan serve
or
php artisan serve --port=80
#start local websocket server
php artisan websockets:serve
```

## Keeping the socket server running in production

Please follow the official documentation [link](https://beyondco.de/docs/laravel-websockets/basic-usage/starting#keeping-the-socket-server-running-with-supervisord)
